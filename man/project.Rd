\usage{
project(
  x,
  R,
  si,
  n_sim = 100,
  n_days = 7,
  R_fix_within = FALSE,
  model = c("poisson", "negbin"),

  time_change = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{incidence} object containing daily incidence; other time
intervals will trigger an error.}

\item{R}{A vector of numbers representing plausible reproduction numbers; for
instance, these can be samples from a posterior distribution using the
\code{earlyR} or \code{EpiEstim} packages. If \code{time_change} is provided, then it must
be a \code{vector} (for fixed values of R per time window) or a \code{list} of
vectors (for separate distributions of R per time window), with one element
more than the number of dates in \code{time_change}.}

\item{si}{A function computing the serial interval, or a \code{numeric} vector
providing its mass function, starting a day 1, so that si\link{i} is the PMF for
serial interval of \code{i}. The model implicitly assumes that \code{si[0] = 0}. For
functions, we strongly recommend using the RECON package \code{distcrete}
to obtain such distribution (see example).}

\item{n_sim}{The number of epicurves to simulate. Defaults to 100.}

\item{n_days}{The number of days to run simulations for. Defaults to 14.}

\item{R_fix_within}{A logical indicating if R should be fixed within
simulations (but still varying across simulations). If \code{FALSE}, R is
drawn for every simulation and every time step. Fixing values within
simulations favours more extreme predictions (see details)}

\item{model}{Distribution to be used for projections. Must be one of
"poisson" or "negbin" (negative binomial process). Defaults to poisson}

\item{size}{size parameter of negative binomial distribition. Ignored if
model is poisson}

\item{time_change}{an optional vector of times at which the simulations
should use a different sample of reproduction numbers, provided in days
into the simulation (so that day '1' is the first day after the input
\code{incidence} object); if provided, \code{n} dates in \code{time_change} will produce
\code{n+1} time windows, in which case \code{R} should be a list of vectors of \code{n+1}
\code{R} values, one per each time window.}

\item{instantaneous_R}{a boolean specifying whether to assume \code{R} is the case
reproduction number (\code{instantaneous_R = FALSE}, the default), or the
instantaneous reproduction number (\code{instantaneous_R = TRUE}).
If \code{instantaneous_R = FALSE} then values of \code{R} at time \code{t} will govern the
mean number of secondary cases of all cases infected at time \code{t},
even if those secondary cases appear after \code{t}. In other words, \code{R}
will characterise onwards transmission from infectors depending on their
date of infection.
If \code{instantaneous_R = TRUE} then values of \code{R} at time \code{t} will govern the
mean number of secondary cases made at time \code{t} by all cases infected
before \code{t}. In other words, \code{R} will characterise onwards transmission at
a given time.}
}
\description{
This function simulates future incidence based on past incidence data, a
selection of plausible reproduction numbers (R), and the distribution of the
serial interval (time from primary onset to secondary onset).
}
\details{
The decision to fix R values within simulations
(\code{R_fix_within}) reflects two alternative views of the uncertainty
associated with R. When drawing R values at random from the provided
sample, (\code{R_fix_within} set to \code{FALSE}), it is assumed that R
varies naturally, and can be treated as a random variable with a given
distribution. When fixing values within simulations (\code{R_fix_within}
set to \code{TRUE}), R is treated as a fixed parameter, and the uncertainty
is merely a consequence of the estimation of R. In other words, the first
view is rather Bayesian, while the second is more frequentist.
